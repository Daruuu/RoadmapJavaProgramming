0The fog was as thick as pea soup. This was a problem. Gary was driving but couldn't
 see a thing in front of him. He knew he should stop, but the road was narrow so if
 he did, it would be right in the center of the road. He was sure that another car w
 ould end up rear-ending him, so he continued forward despite the lack of visibility.
 This was an unwise move.
Don't be scared. The things out there that are unknown aren't scary in themselves.
They are just unknown at the moment. Take the time to know them before you list them as scary.
Then the world will be a much less scary place for you.

she found what she least expected to see.
